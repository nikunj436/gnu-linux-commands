# Getting Started

## Launching a GNU-Linux OS using Virtual Machine

### Requirements

* ISO image of the GNU-Linux OS.

> [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.5/?_ga=2.125119434.1524606981.1671093211-1303727683.1671093211) for x86_64 platform

* Hosted Hypervisor
    - Virtualization helps to run different operating systems using same physical resources.
    - Hypervisor is a software which makes virtualization possible.
    - If your machine does not support dual boot, you may need a hosted hypervisor to run the GNU-Linux operating system. 
    - Hosted hypervisors runs within another operating system known as host operating system. The operating system installed within hypervisor is called guest operating system.
    - e.g.
        * [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
        * [VMware Workstation Player](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/17_0)
 
* Adequate space on hard disk. (20 GB - 50 GB, depending on requirement.)

### Steps

* Download Ubuntu ISO file. 
* Download hypervisor.
* Install the hypervisor
* Launch the hypervisor and configure a virtual machine.
* Launch the virtual machine.

## Launching a GNU/Linux OS using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
